<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to extend text properties of appointments exported to iCalendar format (to add meeting requests with attendees)</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how you can export e-mail addresses stored in a database to the ics file as required attendees. 
The XtraScheduler originally does not support meeting requests with attendees. To accomplish this task, use the CustomFields mechanism to bind e-mail data to scheduler appointments. To control the export process that is performed via the Export method of the iCalendarExporter (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraScheduleriCalendariCalendarExportertopic) class, handle its AppointmentExporting (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerExchangeAppointmentExporter_AppointmentExportingtopic) event. Within the event handler, you can modify VEvent object's properties and extend it with custom text properties. 
To create a new text property - ATTENDEE in this case - create an object of the DevExpress.XtraScheduler.iCalendar.Components.TextProperty type, specify required parameters (CN and RSVP) and add this property to the DevExpress.XtraScheduler.iCalendar.Components.iCalendarPropertyCollection of custom properties. This collection is accessible via the CustomProperties property of the current VEvent object.
The sample project contains an MS Access (mdb) database and a custom AppointmentForm so you can edit custom fields containing e-mail data. 
To see the result, open the saved ics file in MS Outlook, double-click the imported appointment  and see addresses of the attendees displayed in the Meeting form.</p>
